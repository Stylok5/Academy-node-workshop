Node.js Workshop

## Branch description

In this branch we will introduce REPL. REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, and it's a great way to explore
the Node features in a quick way.

## Branch Tasks

1. Open a terminal and print the installed node.js version
2. Execute the contents of the main.js file.
3. In the terminal start using the REPL.
4. In the editor mode write JavaScript code to map throught an array of data and use the console to print each item to the stdout. (when you are done type .exit)

`const data = ['Hello Node.js', 'Node is fun', 'I love Nodel.js']`

## Covers

- Node basic usage
- REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)
