Node.js Workshop

## Branch description

In this branch we will use the REPL to execute JavaScript code.
REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, and it's a great way to explore
the Node features in a quick way.

## Branch Tasks

1. Execute the contents of the init.js file.
2. In the terminal type ```node``` to start using the REPL. Follow the instructions to open the editor.
3. In the editor mode write JavaScript code to create a function that takes one argument(name:string) and prints the name
__Hello ${name}__ to the stdout. Finally call that function.

```
> .editor
// Entering editor mode (^D <ctrl>-D to finish, ^C <ctrl>-C to cancel)

/** write your code in here.. **/

// ^D
'Hello Foo'
```
